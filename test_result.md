# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
# ## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
# ## backend:
# ##   - task: "Task name"
# ##     implemented: true
# ##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##     file: "file_path.py"
# ##     stuck_count: 0
# ##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
# ##     needs_retesting: false
# ##     status_history:
# ##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

# ##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# ##   run_ui: false
# ##
# ## test_plan:
# ##   current_focus:
# ##     - "Task name 1"
# ##     - "Task name 2"
# ##   stuck_tasks:
# ##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
# ##   test_all: false
# ##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
# ##
# ## agent_communication:
# ##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
# ##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  Document scanning application for Vietnamese land documents with automatic naming using short codes.
  NEW FEATURE: Folder scanning - Upload ZIP file with folder structure, scan all images, return ZIP with PDFs maintaining folder structure.
  Previous features: 35% crop + quốc huy detection, optimized image size 1024px, rules management UI.

Added helper functions: extract_zip_and_find_images, create_result_zip. Limits: 500 files, 500MB max. Uses same analyze_document_with_vision logic with semaphore concurrency control (MAX_CONCURRENT=5)."

TESTED: 1) Basic folder scan with test ZIP (3 images in 2 folders) - processed successfully, 2) Response validation - all required fields present (scan_id, total_files, success_count, processing_time, files, download_url), 3) Folder structure preservation - PDFs created in exact same folder structure as original images, 4) Download functionality - result ZIP downloaded successfully with correct PDF structure, 5) Error handling - correctly rejects non-ZIP files and empty ZIPs with 400 status, 6) Large folder structures - handles deep nested folders correctly, 7) Mixed file types - correctly processes only image files (.jpg, .png, etc.), 8) File size limits - handles multiple files within limits, 9) Unicode filenames - supports Vietnamese characters in folder/file names, 10) Concurrent processing - uses semaphore (MAX_CONCURRENT=5) for parallel image processing. Backend logs confirm: ZIP extraction working, image detection working, smart cropping applied, LLM integration functional, PDF creation successful, result ZIP generation working. All endpoints functional: POST /api/scan-folder and GET /api/download-folder-result/{filename}. Feature is production-ready!"

      Implemented OpenAI primary provider (gpt-4o-mini) with Emergent fallback, plus /api/llm/health and Admin LLM Status tile. Please test:
      1) GET /api/llm/health — expect:
         - If OPENAI_API_KEY missing but EMERGENT_LLM_KEY present: status=degraded, openai_available=false, emergent_available=true
         - If both keys present and valid: status=healthy, openai_available=true
      2) POST /api/scan-document — ensure analysis still returns structured result using fallback if OpenAI not available (requires auth: seed admin via GET /api/setup-admin, login, then call)
      3) Frontend: After login as admin, open Admin Panel and verify LLM Status tile shows correct states and updates on refresh.
      Note: Do not change protected env vars. OPENAI_API_KEY must be set in backend/.env and backend restarted to enable primary provider.
